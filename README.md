# qrgen0
This is a QR code generator that I managed to built from scratch in just 8 days. It has some features like all version support (1 - 40), 3 Encoding Mode (Numeric, Alphanumeric, Byte) it also has a CLI and Bitmap exporter. Obviously, a lot of the parts in the code are unoptimized that is due to limitations in time and my skill, it was fun though :).
