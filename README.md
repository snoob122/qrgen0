# qrgen0 - A pure python qr code generator

**qrgen0** is a fully functional, zero-dependency qr code generator written entirely in Python - without a single import. Built from scratch in 8 days, it supports:

- All QR Version (1 - 40)
- Numeric, Alphanumeric and Byte Encoding
- A masking optimisation system
- Bitmap (.bmp) output without Pillow
- ASCII output for terminal or raw file rendering (stored in .txt file)
- A not the best but functional CLI 
- Settings Saved automatically in config (.cfg) file

Once you run it, you will be met with the default CLI that I created, if you prefer prompts over CLI you can change using_cli at line 4

It was a miracle that I managed to pull this off considering my coding skill and the difficulty of this, well it was fun atleast.
